What is it?
-----------

ConLangGen is a program that procedurally generates constructed languages
(conlangs).

Conlangs are languages whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary have been
consciously devised for human or human-like communication, instead of having
developed naturally. They are also referred to as an artificial or invented
language.
